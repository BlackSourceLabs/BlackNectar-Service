# Intro

The Database for BlackNectar is created in the "blacknectar" Schema.
It uses the user `blacknectar` to access the tables and perform queries and updates.


## PostGIS Support
Note that PostGIS function are stored in the `public` schema and must be
referenced using using fully-qualified syntaxt (i.e., `public.ST_Distance()`).

You can also add it to the to the search path. 
This is done by altering the user and adding the `search_path` parameter with a value of `public`.
This lets the user use `postgis` functions in other schemas,
like the `blacknectar` schema.
